# BBB 16 SMD

**WIP, Do not use**

The BBB16 SMD is a surface mount Beaglebone version of the PB16. All the design files are open source and available on github.

To order PCBs upload the ["GERBER-BBB_16.zip"](https://github.com/computergeek1507/PB_16/raw/master/BBB_16_SMD/jlcpcb/gerber/GERBER-BBB_16.zip) file in the "jlcpcb\gerber" folder to jlcpcb.com. Enable the SMD service, 'BOM-BBB_16.csv' is the SMD BOM and 'POS-BBB_16.csv' is the SMD CPL position file.
