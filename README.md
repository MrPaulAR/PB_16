# PB 16

![Image of Rev C Controller](https://github.com/computergeek1507/PB_16/raw/master/PB_16_rev_C.jpg)

The PB16 Pixel Controller is designed as an open source DIY hobbyist controller. A Pocketbeagle running FPP drives the 16 pixel ports and 2 serial ports. The design was made with all through hole components for easy assembly by most users. It is designed to be modular and support many use cases. It runs a full Linux operating system with ethernet, WIFI and audio supported over the USB port. It can run in standalone, or be used with other controllers/devices. It is 140mm (5’) wide by 103mm(4’) tall. The controllers small form factor and simplistic design are intended to limit overall cost. All the design files are open source and available on github. Open source applications were used to create this controller. [KiCad](http://kicad.org/) was used for the PCB design, and [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) for the documentation.

To order your own PCB upload the gerber.zip file to your favorite PCB manufacture of choice, I personally use [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/).

## Addon Boards

The PB16 Controller contains an expansion header. The expansion header can drive 16 additional pixel ports. I have also created addition addon boards to work with the expansion port. These Expansions will work with Kulp Controllers, but **not** Falcon Controllers.

* [**16 Expansion**](16_Expansion/README.md) - 16 Port Local Expansion.
* [**16 Expansion SMD**](16_Expansion_SMD/README.md) - 16 Port Local Expansion. This is a **Surface Mount(SMD)** Design.
* [**Diff Expansion**](Diff_Expansion/README.md) - 4 Port Remote Differential Expansion.
* [**Multi Expansion**](Multi_Expansion/README.md) - 8 Port Local & 2 Port Remote Differential Expansion.
* [**Quad Diff Out**](Quad_Diff_Out/README.md) - 1 Port Remote Differential Expansion.
* [**Four Out**](Four_Out/README.md) - 4 Port Local Expansion.
* [**Receiver Out**](Receiver_Out/README.md) - 4 Port Remote Receiver Board for use with Remote Differential Expansions.
* [**Receiver Out SMD**](Receiver_Out_SMD/README.md) - 4 Port Remote Receiver Board for use with Remote Differential Expansions. This is a **Surface Mount(SMD)** Design.

## Variants

I created some addition variants of the PB 16, to use with other controller systems and fit some specific needs.

* [**BBB 16**](BBB_16/README.md) - Beaglebone Version with 16 pixel ports, 2 serial ports and an expansion header for additional 16 pixel outputs.
* [**BBB 16 Flex**](BBB_16_Flex/README.md) - BBB 16 PCB to use with the HolidayCoro Flex System. This is a **Surface Mount(SMD)** Design.
* [**PB 16 Expansion**](PB_16_Expansion/README.md) - Small Form Factor PB 16 with Two Expansion Board Ports for 32 outputs.
* [**PB 16 Mini**](PB_16_Mini/README.md) - Small Form Factor PB 16 with one Expansion Board Port for 16 ouputs and two Serial Outputs.
* [**PB 16 Flex**](PB_16_Flex/README.md) - PB 16 PCB to use with the HolidayCoro Flex System.
* [**PB 16 E682**](PB_16_E682/README.md) - Adapter PCB to use a Pocketbeagle with a Sandevice E682. (This is a proof of concept, not designed for extended use)
* [**PB 16 E682 Serial**](PB_16_E682_Serial/README.md) - Serial Output PCB to for PB 16 E682 or PB 16 Expansion.
