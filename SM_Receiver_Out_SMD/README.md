# Receiver Out SMD

The "SM Receiver Out SMD" is a 4 port "Smart" Differential Receiver output board for the PB16. The Firmware is incomplete and this PCB is basically useless until then it works. This design is surface mount based and is harder to solder. All the design files are open source and available on github.

**WIP** Work in progress, not tester and no firmware is available.

<!---To order PCBs upload the gerber.zip file to jlcpcb.com. Enable the SMD service, 'Receiver_Out_SMD.csv' is the SMD BOM and 'Receiver_Out-all-pos.csv' is the SMD CPL position file.
